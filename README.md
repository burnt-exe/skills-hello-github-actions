## üöÄ Step 5: Trigger the workflow

You've now added a fully functioning workflow to your repository! :rocket:

The shell script in the workflow will automatically run whenever a new pull request is opened, providing seamless automation for your development process.

### üîç Seeing your **action** in action

The status of each workflow run is prominently displayed in the pull request before it's merged:

‚úÖ **All checks have passed** - Your workflow executed successfully  
‚ùå **Some checks failed** - There might be issues that need your attention

You can track all your workflow runs in the **Actions** tab of your repository. From there, you can:
- View detailed execution logs
- Debug failed runs
- Re-run workflows
- Download artifacts

## ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Trigger the workflow

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">

1. Create a new branch named `test-workflow`
2. Make a change, such as adding an emoji to your README.md file
3. Commit the change directly to your new branch
4. In the **Pull requests** tab, create a pull request to merge `test-workflow` into `main`
5. Watch the workflow running in the checks section of the pull request
6. Notice the automatic comment added by the workflow to your pull request
7. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page for instructions on the next step

> üí° **Pro tip**: GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax for workflow configuration. You can create complex automation pipelines by combining different actions from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).
